                    <p>
                        Welcome everyone! I look forward to meeting you if I haven't already. My name is Brian Ulatowski and this is my first
                        basic portfolio website. I graduated from Cal State University Northridge in 2005 with a BA in Liberal Studies and a
                        focus in teaching math and a Teaching Credential. I have taught for 14 years, in public and private schools, including
                        charter schools and internationally in Cambodia, Vietnam and Costa Rica. I've taught mostly math subjects, but have also
                        taught English as a Second Language, History, Language Arts, Science, Humanities, as well as other stuff. Currently, I'm
                        taking a full stack web development program via Trilogy at UCLA Extension. My hope is that I can transition into a
                        career in web development.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, especially my wife. I enjoy traveling to different
                        places, especially places that speak different languages and have different cultures than what we are used to here in
                        the US. I've had the privilege of traveling through more than 25 different countries. Usually budget travel. Once flew
                        round trip to Guatemala from Los Angeles for $72 including tax. I've been turned down for a job because I didn't look
                        'American enough.' I've moved a lot more than most; more times than years I've been alive. I do my best to stay active
                        and get in exercise several times each week, as it helps me to maintain my sanity. I'm extremely afraid of heights. I am
                        a very picky eater, but I love to eat and I also love to cook, but my actual cooking skills are still progressing. I
                        enjoy watching movies and shows, especially realistic dramas or comedies. I care about people and the community around
                        me.

                        or web development stuff.

                            Cocktails? Is a mobile responsive web application built from scratch by four collaborators, designed to give users
                            different ideas for drinks based on a given main ingredient. Using a server side API, users can use it when out and
                            wondering what they should order or while at home, what they can make.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The user inputs an ingredient and can search through drink options that include that ingredient. Then they are provided
                            the drink name, instructions on how to make the drink, a recipe with amounts of various ingredients, and a photo of the
                            drink. Users can ‘like’ and save drinks they enjoy, which then pins the drink name on the side and they can easily
                            return to the drink whenever they would like. The app is hosted by Heroku with cloud based database JawsDB, that saves
                            user data.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The landing page is a short video, has buttons linking to signup and login pages. The signup page includes inputs for
                            email, password, date of birth and a username. The email includes a validator to ensure an email is entered. The
                            password has a validator to ensure that the password entered is within the necessary range of the number of characters.
                            The date of birth has a validator to ensure users are over 21 in order to use the app, and if not, sends them to a fun
                            age appropriate page. And the app features a logout function so users can ensure their liked drinks are protected.

                            In or Out is a website application built from scratch designed to simplify an everyday problem. Utilizing integrated
                            data from several server-side API requests, "In or Out" simplifies the decision making between creating meal
                            alternatives or finding a great local eatery at a desired location.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            If "In" is chosen, the user can input a food item which will then provide several recipe options. Each result displays
                            the amount of time it takes to complete, dish rating, serving size, and a link displaying the step by step process to
                            complete the meal.
                            <br>

                            <img class="extrapic extrapic3" align="right" src="assets/images/inRecipes.png" alt="">
                            If "Out" is chosen, the user is prompted to input both a specific food and/or the desired location they wish to search.
                            Once entered, the display will provide several options depending on the original input. Each item listed will include
                            the name of the location, average rating, address, phone number, and a link redirecting the user to customer reviews.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In or Out is hosted GitHub and is designed to be responsive.

                    <p>
                        Welcome everyone! I look forward to meeting you if I haven't already. My name is Brian Ulatowski and this is my first
                        basic portfolio website. I graduated from Cal State University Northridge in 2005 with a BA in Liberal Studies and a
                        focus in teaching math and a Teaching Credential. I have taught for 14 years, in public and private schools, including
                        charter schools and internationally in Cambodia, Vietnam and Costa Rica. I've taught mostly math subjects, but have also
                        taught English as a Second Language, History, Language Arts, Science, Humanities, as well as other stuff. Currently, I'm
                        taking a full stack web development program via Trilogy at UCLA Extension. My hope is that I can transition into a
                        career in web development.
